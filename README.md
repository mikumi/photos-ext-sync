# photos-ext-sync

Sync your Lightroom photo session into the macOS photo library.

## Suggested workflow:

1. Export all originals from Photos library into a folder of your choice
2. Edit RAW photos in Lightroom
3. When done, say `File->Export`, chose your output folder and `jpeg`, and hit `Export`
4. Mark all originals in your Photos library and chose `Image->Edit With`. No need to switch all photos to RAW first, as Lightroom already has those. This will create official editing sessions for all the pictures, which can then be overwritten with the jpes generated by lightroom.
5. Run this script to sync your jpegs back into the Photos Library


## Usage:

`photos-ext-sync [photos library path] path-to-your-output-folder`
